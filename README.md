# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock Paper and Scissors game with python

A brief summary:
When the program is run, the player is asked to enter an option between "R", "P" or "S"
If user input is invalid (not amongst our options), print an error, and ask for their input again 
If the two players choose the same option itâ€™s a tie, and the game repeats
